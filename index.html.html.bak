      <h3>Leonard Dascalete / Andu</h3>
      <p> Hello,</p> 
	  
	  <p>
	  I am Leonard Dascalete, known as Andu. I have always loved computers and admired the amount
	  of happiness and usefulness they can give us. I have coded some projects before bootcamp, some
	  websites, a 2D RPG game and other small stuff, yet they were all done in different languages
	  and without any help from my teachers, but the internet came through for me ;) which meant 
	  I didn't master any language in the end. It was interesting to learn java from the ground up
	  and remind myself how coding worked, although I've still got a lot to learn and I can't wait to
	  call myself someone knowledgable in coding.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Gambling rectangles</h3>
    <p>
	My first java programming project, and I wanted to make it something special
	and unusual. In this processing game I have a combination of classes, variables, 
	if statements and other things that we have learnt in class. I've created a 2D game 
	in which you, the player, is trying to survive for as long as possible against the ever
	teleporting enemy (which is teleporting randomly with no correlation to it's original position).
	If you manage to survive for at least 1 minute, then you will win the
	game. You simply need to be lucky to win, it's pure gamble, simple right?
	The player and the enemy both have their own class for ease of use in the
	future if I ever want to make more enemies, levels etc. The game can be modified
	easily to change it's core gameplay at any point because the variables are what
	really determines the way that it's going to be played.

    <h3>Java Game Project 2022: "Give them hell!"</h3>
    <p>
	Project description and insight: </p>

    <p>
	For my first big project in coding I have done a 2D Video game using the City engine, the game is called "Give them hell"
	I was able to use most of what we have learned in our lessons and I am happy with how it developed over time.
	This project rocketed my knowledge in Java, as we have dived deep into coding by using things like loading and saving
	classes, which require more complex arrays and tokens, collision systems, step listeners, multiple enemies/pickups,
	distinct levels and transitioning between them. These are just a glimpse of the amount of things I have learned and
	used in my game. The best part is I can see where I need to make improvements and if I had used my time more wisely
	I am sure I could have made something a lot better.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Game description:
	The game is merciless, it doesn't allow you to touch the enemy even once, but if you get surged, you are the one
	who can kill the enemy in one shot, the idea is that everyone one shots each other, which puts a lot more
	emphasis on holding onto your life and attacking your enemy's
